Special Features
- Oracle writes Proof-of-Reserve to Blockchain (how many gemstones in ESU are in vault and can be minted)
- Mint function is limited to Proof-of-Reserve (amount of stones) and Emerald Standard Unit (ESU)
- Redeem must be transparent and results in burning of Token
- ESU changes about 0.1% per month (reduction, which results in more tokens to be allowed to be minted)

Roles
- Owner: owner of the contract, allowed to upgrade the contract
- Minter: allowed to mint and burn tokens
- ESU per Token Modifier: allowed to update the ESU per token
- Pauser: allowed to pause/unpause tokens
- Custodian: allowed to freeze/unfreeze tokens
- Limiter: allowed to block/unblock users
